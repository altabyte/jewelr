== README

After cloning this project remember to also clone the private seed data.

    $ pushd private_data

    $ git clone jewelr_private_data  # From BitBucket.org

    $ popd

    $ ./private_data/setup.sh

# Generate UIDs

    $ ./bin/rake uid:generate

    $ ./bin/rake uid:reset_sequence_index

or if you need the sequence to start at a specific value, such as 100:

    $ ./bin/rake "uid:reset_sequence_index[100]"

Note the quotes around the rake task name when passing arguments!
